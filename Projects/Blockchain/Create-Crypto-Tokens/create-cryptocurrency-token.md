# Create Cryptocurrency Tokens

Inspiration and Source: YouTube Channel **NetworkChuck**, [you need to create a Cryptocurrency RIGHT NOW!! (Solana token)](https://youtu.be/befUVytFC80)

* Proof of History (PoH)

## Create Solana (SOL) Wallet

Download Solana (SOL):
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.5/install)"
```

_Note: for a Raspberry Pi you'll have to download the prebuilt binaries._

Create Solana Wallet Address:
```
solana-keygen new
```

_Note: keep your passphrase safe!_

To check your current balance:
```
solana balance
```

## Buy SOL and transfer

Now we need to buy and transfer SOL from your crypto exchange to your Wallet:
* Grab your SOL Wallet Address and use Coinbase to transfer the SOL there.

## Prep Linux

Update your repository:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean && sudo apt clean
```

Install Rust:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

_Note: exit and log back in._

```
sudo apt install libudev-dev
```

```
sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config -y
```

```
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

Use Rust to install Solana's Token program (this might take some time...):
```
cargo install spl-token-cli
```

_Note: This will require at least 4GB RAM on your server/device. More info on the [Token Program Dev Docs](https://spl.solana.com/token)._

## Create Cryptocurrency Token

Create a Token:
```
spl-token create-token
```
_Note: this will use your SOL to create the Token. Copy the token address (henceforth TOKEN_ADDRESS) for later._

Create an account that can hold the Token:
```
spl-token create-account TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

_Note: this will also use some of your SOL. Copy the token account for later._

Fill the Account with Tokens by minting Tokens:
```
spl-token mint TOKEN_ADDRESS SUPPLY_OF_TOKENS TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

To view what we just created:
```
spl-token accounts
```

## Transfer Tokens to External Wallets

In order to transfer Tokens out to another Wallet:
* Copy a SOL Wallet Address (i.e. Phantom Wallet) and we need to create an account to transfer SOL to that Wallet if they don't already have an account:
```
spl-token transfer --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient TOKEN_ADDRESS TOKEN_AMOUNT EXTERNAL_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

To visualize what we just did go to [Solscan](https://solscan.io/) and look for your TOKEN_ADDRESS.

_Note: External SOL Wallet is now being used to do the transfers._

## Token Branding

Create your own Token brand: name + symbol + logo (needs to be `.png` and less than 200 Kilobytes).

We then navigate to [Solana's GitHub Token List](https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list), where all SOL Tokens are listed.

Steps:
1. Fork the Repository
2. Once forked, click on the browser window of the forked repo, and click `.` (period button) to open VSCode in-browser... If this does not work, we can do it manually by going through each folder.
3. Go to the folder `assets/mainnet` where all Token addresses are displayed.
4. Create a new folder with your own TOKEN_ADDRESS.
5. Upload your `logo.png` (remember, it needs to be less than 200KB).
6. Now go to the folder `src/tokens` and go to the file `solana.tokenlist.json`.
7. We will copy one part:
```
{
      "chainId": 101,
      "address": "2fvPmqYk1NemSQ3NFUSu3zw3LgiZKxzFoz79oqkKdmaY",
      "symbol": "PXE",
      "name": "PixieCat",
      "decimals": 0,
      "logoURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidJKTofan/pixie-crypto-token/main/logo.png",
      "tags": [
        "social-token"
      ]
},
```
8. Scroll to the bottom of the JSON file, paste the part we copied and edit them:
* Change address with your TOKEN_ADDRESS.
* Change the symbol and name.
* Change `logoURI` with your own raw `logo.png`.
9. Finally, add `Adding PixieCat token` as the reason for your commit, and commit.
10. Go back to the original `Solana's GitHub Token List` and click on `Pull requests`, and click `new pull request`.
11. Click on `compare across forks`, and change the `head repository` to our forked repo.
12. Click on `create pull request` and we wait...
13. After (hopefully) a few minutes, we can go back to [Solscan](https://solscan.io/) and look for your TOKEN_ADDRESS, and voalÃ¡!

Congratulations! We created our own Token ðŸ¤“

## Giving away PixieCat(s)

In collaboration with a colleague, we created [PixieCat (PXE) Tokens](https://github.com/DavidJKTofan/pixie-crypto-token) as a present for another colleague of ours, who is a true crypto-fan and proud cat-owner.

Whoever is interested in receiving some PXE too, feel free to send me your SOL Wallet address.

Or if you want to send me some Tokens, here is my SOL Wallet address: `7zAdKsbmNcChFMtiRDunyv4rm3py5WQJAGJEgg9fLFmG`

Thank you!
