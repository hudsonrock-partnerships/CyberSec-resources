# CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Super Secure Startup's private information is being leaked; can you find out how?

***
***

1. Downloaded the attached ZIP file and extracted the content. A quick Google search will lead you to ```@SuperSecStartup``` Twitter account.

2. Unzip the ZIP file until we reach the ZIP file ```username``` and tried finding the password to extract it on Twitter, which will eventually lead us to the Twitter user ```@JTerranwald```, and the user ```j.terranwald``` will be the password to exctract the ZIP.

3. However, now we have to find the password for the next ZIP file, which will lead us to look elsewhere, finding ```Bianka Phelps``` on Twitter who posted an interesting picture with a photoshoped text on it saying: ```SupSecStart#Winter2018!```.

4. Unfortuntaly that will not be the password, but looking back at ```@SuperSecStartup```, they posted that ```@JTerranwald``` started employment in Spring 2019. Therefore the password will be: ```SupSecStart#Spring2019!```.

5. Exctracting the final ZIP will give us the flag.
