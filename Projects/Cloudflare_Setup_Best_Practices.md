# Cloudflare

A brief and general guide on how to **set up a Cloudflare account**, **add a Zone (domain)**, as well as some **Best Practices** on Security and Performance solutions, including some Admin best practices.

Another very good starting place is the [Core Setup](https://www.cloudflare.com/welcome-center/core-setup/) guide on Cloudflare.

_Disclaimer: This is for educational purposes only, and depending on the situation, some configurations or steps might differ, or change, or have different impacts._

# Enterprise Best Practices

## Secure Origin IP Addresses

_Orange-Cloud all DNS Records for HTTP(S) traffic from your origin._

How a **Grey-Clouded** record looks like:
```
dig greycloud.theburritobot.com @woz.ns.cloudflare.com +short
```

How an **Orange-Cloude** record looks like:
```
dig orangecloud.theburritobot.com @woz.ns.cloudflare.com +short
```

## Configure your Security Level selectively

On **Page Rules**, select the URL pattern and set the Security Level Setting to High.

_Note:_ decrease the Security Level for non-sensitive paths or APIs to reduce false positives.

_Security Level settings are aligned with a threat scores that IP addresses acquire with malicious behavior on our network. A threat score above 10 is considered high and 50 is really bad._

## Activate your Web Application Firewall safely

1. First, set the **OWASP ModSecurity** sensitivity to High with an action of Simulate in order to log any false positives.

2. Second, activate **Managed Rules** (Cloudflare Specials) and any platform-specific groups you use.

3. Finally, turn your WAF ON with the global setting.

# Performance Best Practices

## Activate Web Content Optimization (WCO) Features

* Enable **Polish** for image compression.

* Enable **minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. 

* Test **Mirage** (mobile specific image optimization) and **Rocket Loader** (forces JavaScript to be loaded asynchronously) with your system.

* Enable **Cache Everything** for static HTML webpages on **Page Rules**.

* Utilize conservative **TTLs (Time-to-Lives)** for content that changes occasionally.

Check the response header `CF-Cache-Status`:
```
curl -I theburritobot.com | grep -Fi CF-Cache-Status
```

* Accelerate your dynamic content with **Railgun** (compresses previously unreachable web objects).

# Admin Best Practices

## Manage your brand by customizing Cloudflare pages

* **Domain-wide**: within the settings of each domain, you can go to the Customize application to change the default pages for each and every page we could potentially show your users.

* **Organization-wide**: if you have many domains within your CloudFlare account and would like to create Custom pages for all of them, you may do so within your Organization settings.

## Enforce 2-factor authentication across your entire organization

On the upper right hand corner, select **My Profile** > Authentication > Two-Factor Authentication.

Alternatively, go on **Manage Account** > Members > Member 2FA enforcement, in order to require all members to have two-factor authentication enabled.

## Full Setup

Full Setup: use the setup wizard on Cloudflare's website when you register, follow the steps, and change your Domain's Nameservers.

Add A Record:
```
A	www	IP_ADDRESS	Auto	Proxied
```

Alternatively, one can do a [CNAME Setup](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020348832-Understanding-a-CNAME-Setup)

## Troubleshooting

### MTU Size

Get the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size on your device:
```
networksetup -getMTU en0
```

Do a Browser Integrity Check (BIC), which should return a 403 status code:
```
curl http://cf-testing.com --header "User-Agent: CloudFlare BIC Test" --verbose --silent 2>&1 | egrep -i "< HTTP|< Server:|< CF|<title>|signature"
```

### Check DNS Propagation & Response

Check A Record for a **Full Setup**: https://dnschecker.org/#A/staging.dt-cname.cf.cdn.cloudflare.net OR `curl -svo /dev/null/ http://staging.dt-cname.cf/ 2>&1 | grep 'HTTP'`

cURL is a command line tool used to transport data using the URL syntax:
```
curl -svo /dev/null/ https://staging.dt-cname.cf/
```

Use cURL option to check the origin response directly:
```
curl -svo /dev/null/ https://staging.dt-cname.cf/ --connect-to ::35.234.81.115
```

Check TXT record for a **CNAME Setup**: https://dnschecker.org/#TXT/CLOUDFLARE-VERIFY.dt-cname.cf

https://staging.dt-cname.cf/cdn-cgi/trace 


Check the Cloudflare Response:
```
curl -svo /dev/null/ https://staging.dt-cname.cf/ 
```
```
Server: cloudflare
```

### Check Origin Server Response

Check the Origin Response:
```
curl -svo /dev/null/ http://35.234.81.115/
```
```
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) (bypasses Cloudflare)
```

### Check Nameservers

Check Nameservers:
```
dig +short NS cf-testing.com
host -t NS cf-testing.com
```

Run DNS queries and check DNS records:
```
dig @1.1.1.1 https://staging.dt-cname.cf/
```

### traceroute / mtr

traceroute and tracert are computer network diagnostic commands for displaying possible routes (paths) and measuring transit delays of packets:
```
traceroute staging.dt-cname.cf
```

mtr is a network based command line tools used to measure performance/latency on a particular path to a given host/destination:
```
sudo mtr staging.dt-cname.cf
```

## Allow Cloudflare IPs

Allow Cloudflare IP Addresses:
https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201897700-Allowing-Cloudflare-IP-addresses 

Restoring original visitor IPs:
https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170786-Restoring-original-visitor-IPs 

Display all current settings of the IP packet filter:
```
sudo iptables -L -nv
```

Input Cloudflare IP Addresses (See Screenshot)

## Log Retention

Log Retention is off by default.
https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/get-started 
Activate via API.
https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/enabling-log-retention 

Scan Open Ports on Origin Server:
https://pentest-tools.com/network-vulnerability-scanning/tcp-port-scanner-online-nmap# 

Turn on the WAF, and then try a PHP Code Injection Test:
```
curl -svo /dev/null/ "https://www.dt-cname.cf/file.php?cmd=echo(shell_exec(%22ls%20/etc/var%22))"
```
```
for i in {1..100}; do curl -svo /dev/null/ -H "exploit: true" "https://www.dt-cname.cf/file.php?cmd=echo(shell_exec(%22ls%20/etc/var%22))" 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"; done;
```

*** 

## Create a Rate Limiting Rule.

Try out the Rate Limiting:
```
for i in {1..200}; do curl -svo /dev/null/ -H "requestflood: true" "https://www.dt-cname.cf/" 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"; done;
```
This shouldnâ€™t impact any good & verified bots like Google, pingdom, etc.

Page Rules to cache everything.

Test the Website Performance:
https://www.webpagetest.org/ 

Custom Purge. (See screenshot)
